#Scam/Lure Avoidance

This page lists, in no particular order, common scams and lures and how to avoid them.

##Specific Lures

* If someone gives you a Lava Titan Pouch, do not summon it and click it and press/hold 2 - pressing 2 will select the Wilderness teleport and select "yes" on the confirmation dialogue.

* Do not enter the Clan Wars Red Portal with anything you are not willing to lose - lurers exploit quirks in the game's pathfinding mechanics to trick you into leaving the safe area at the south of the arena.

* Never accept a teleport offer to Ice Plateau - it is in the Wilderness

* The Edgeville Dungeon enters the wilderness even though it is underground. Be aware of where the wilderness begins and do not cross that line, especially if someone asks you to show them where Earth Warriors or Chaos Druids are.

* Do not follow the strangers through the following: the Agility shortcuts to the east of the Trollheim and God Wars Dungeon beacons, the East exit from the Ghorrok fortress, the guards at the neck of the Daemonheim peninsula, the teleport lever in southern Edgeville, the teleport lever northwest of Ardougne castle.

* Be aware that the following Ancient Magicks teleport spells will send you to the Wilderness: Dareeyak, Carrallanger, Annakarl, Ghorrok.

* Never drop anything you care about. Ever. Especially never drop anything you care about if someone is offering money (or any other reward) for doing so.

* When selling an item to someone you don't know, do not accept other items as payment, especially if the item is within a few months old. The trade-window value is most likely higher than the item's true market value.

* Do not buy items off the GE for strangers who claim to have hit their GE buy limit on that item.

##General Advice

* Know where the boundaries of dangerous PvP areas are, and stay away from them.

* Know what teleports can put you into a dangerous PvP area.

* Never drop anything you care about.

* Be wary of anyone who tries to pay with items instead of cash, or who tries to trade in any manner other than a single direct trade.
