#Common Posts to Avoid

The following types of common posts are considered low-effort and/or low-quality, and may be removed, especially if too many appear on /r/runescape or /r/runescape/new at once:

* Prizes from Treasure Hunter
* [Level 99 chatbox spam](http://i.imgur.com/YqvN2gy.jpg)
* Broadcasted announcements of achievements by famous players
* Memes
* Unusual usernames
* Rewards from newly-released content, especially if content is low-level, rewards are easy to obtain, and everybody else got one too.
* [Shut up Meg](http://oi49.tinypic.com/2ppauk7.jpg)
* Posts solely about finding a famous person or a JMod in-game
* Graphical stretching bugs
* Taking a picture with a camera instead of a screenshot.
