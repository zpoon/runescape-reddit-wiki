##About us
Welcome to the Reddit Clan page! Reddit Clan is a Clan for redditors that play Runescape.

Our main goal is to serve as an active in-game community for Reddit. We have been a Clan for several years, our home world is World 4, and the majority of our members can be found there at any time. We also have a Tier 7 Citadel, and ranks in the Clan can be earned every week by capping at the Citadel.

We are often on Mumble, and have our own server. It is open to everyone, especially redditors who play Runescape. The server address is "emp.codes", default port.

The Reddit Clan also has a Clan Bank, which is used to fund events and event prizes. Have an event in mind? Message a Clan Admin below and see if it is worthy of a prize!

If you have any questions about the Clan, feel free to message any other Clan Admin ingame or on Reddit.

Hope to see you in our Clan Chat soon!
