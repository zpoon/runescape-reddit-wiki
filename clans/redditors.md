## About Us

Hello there! You've landed on the [Redditors](http://services.runescape.com/m=clan-home/clan/Redditors) clan wiki page. We also have a [clan subreddit](http://www.reddit.com/r/RedditorsRS).

We are one of the official /r/RuneScape clans, a clan made for redditors, by redditors. We're a community driven clan whose clan members range from newbies to veterans, casual and hardcore players alike. We're a laid back clan that's looking to give redditors a home, and make RuneScape a more enjoyable combined experience.

Being a large international clan, we've opted for having *two* homeworlds: 22 (US) and 36 (EU). Our staff is as diverse as our clan members, and in doing so we try to have an avatar out at all times on at least one of those two worlds.

In an effort to ensure we can have an avatar out at all times, we've set up the “Avatar Warden Programme”, allowing Captains and Generals from our clan to request permission to take out the Avatar for up to 48 hours per week. In other words, 7 non-staff clan members are given the opportunity to take out the avatar every week!

We host a multitude of events and competitions every month, including but not limited to daily sinkholes, biweekly competitions, PvE and PvP events, themed and seasonal events such as trick-or-treating, and more! 

Wanna hang out with us outside of RS? Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/0oAzyeHMAl0I33sR)!

Any questions? Feel free to join our clan chat as a guest and ask!

## Recruitment

Joining our clan is as easy as [joining the clan chat](http://imgur.com/a/We8E2) as a guest, and asking a trial admin+ for an invite.

*Keep in mind that because of our Temporary Avatar Warden, not all admins are allowed to handle invites!*

In order to join our clan you're required to be a RuneScape member and have a reddit account. Be prepared to prove that you're a redditor!
