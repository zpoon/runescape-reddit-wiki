#**Unfinished Business**

For the foreseeable future, the Eternals and Titans will be delivering the updates that have been promised in the past. They will be finishing updates that feel unfinished and improving the core of the game. Since any content that affects or changes old content, for example every single Ninja Fix, is by definition ‘Unfinished Business’ the scope has been narrowed to updates included in the UB10, the Survey or deemed Unfinished Business by Jagex themselves.

#UB10

Ten projects that we’re actively working on or researching. It is our aim that we hold an Unfinished Business update stream at least once a month at least. These are:

1. [Bank Rework] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_bank_rework)
2. [Mining and Smithing Rework] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_mining_and_smithing_rework)
3. ~~Treasure Trails Rework~~ (released)
4. [Dailyscape Reductions] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_dailyscape_reductions)
5. ~~Invention Batch II~~ (released)
6. ~~Achievements Rework~~ (released)
7. ~~Evil Dave Quest~~ (released)
8. [Graphical Reworks] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_graphical_reworks)
9. ~~Combat Pets~~ (released)
10. [Shattered World Improvements] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_shattered_worlds_improvements)

##Bank Rework

* [UI redesign of the new bank.] (https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/news/2016/12/bank-rework.jpg)
* This project is the highest priority.
* This project is currently paused due to a bottleneck.

###[Design Document] (http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?16,17,47,65858594)

All of the information below is what we’re discussing and aiming for. Not everything will make it but we wanted to share as much about the design as we can right now.

**Project aims:**

* Add critical features such as bank placeholders, organisation and customisation.
* Improve the usability of the bank, so that players can use it more efficiently and without friction.
* Bring existing storage and retrieval features into one central area.
* Maintain the current feel of the Runescape bank, so that it’s recognisable to existing and returning players.
* Improve the internal workings of the bank so that it can be maintained and expanded easily.

**Features:**

* Bank Placeholders - whenever a player withdraws the last of items, that item stays in place at 0 quantity so the bank doesn’t shuffle around.
* Ability to put the same item into multiple tabs.
 * For example, having Elder logs in the Fletching and Woodcutting tabs (takes only one bank space).
 * However, you can ‘split’ stacks. For example, having 500 Magic logs in a slayer tab and 400 Magic logs in the Firemaking tab. (Uses two bank spaces if using the split option).
 * This also means you can have multiple cash stacks in your bank as long as they are in different tabs.
* Auto-sorting options
 * Automatically sort a tab based on the level required to make/wear/use.
 * Sort by GE value.
 * Sort by quantity.
 * Sort by custom settings.
 * Tabs to be marked to only accept certain item types.
 * Designate tabs as ‘loot tabs’ and when using auto deposit features like the Pack Yak and Sign of the Porters.
* (Sort of) Unlimited Bank Tabs.
* Tab icons no longer have to be the first item in a tab. You can select any item in the game even if you don’t own it as well as skill icons.
* Customisable cosmetic effects - change bank tab colours, rename tabs and much more.
* Better searching via meta tagging similar to [GE categories] (http://services.runescape.com/m=itemdb_rs/catalogue). For example, searching ‘food’ will bring up all the food in your bank.
* Updating Presets - in the process of seeing whether we can add more presets, as well as beast of burden presets (comes with a significant technical cost).
* Hover over the preset number for the name of the preset.
* Ability to change the preset numbers into icons.
* Diango and POH storage from your bank.
* Huge rewrite of the code.
* Ability to change the number of columns to suit your needs.
* Sub tabs - tab separators that will split the current tab.
* Will look into individual tab valuation.
* No plans to get placeholders of items that you don’t own.
* No plans of adding a way to get rid of multiple items.

##Mining and Smithing Rework

[**Under Construction; please refer to the recent TL;DW in the meantime.**] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/7jem0s/tldw_358_mining_and_smithing_rework_showcase/?utm_content=comments&utm_medium=hot&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=runescape)

##Dailyscape Reductions

* Will be addressed as soon as the revamped poll system is complete. ^[12 ^Sep ^2017]
* The 'daily routine' of things to do is ever-growing and needs to be addressed since players are spending too much of their time doing these activities instead of playing the game (e.g. Divine Caches, Sinkholes, Big Chinchompa etc).
* Don't want those that can't keep up with dailies to feel like they're missing out on a lot of efficiency.
* Put together a number of design options, which are ready to be considered internally.
* Active development will begin as soon as a team is available.
* Ninja team will be taking on this project soon.
* Have a few avenues we can take.
* Mod Moltare wants dailies to stack up so you can do them all at once which would be balanced with a type of shop, which lets you pick and choose which ones to do but not all of them.
* Differents ways of approaching it but what we won’t be doing is stripping out content.
* We want to hear from players.

##Graphical Reworks

* Unlikely to be doing Oog'log or Dorgeshuun next because they are rarely visited - other places like Varrock should take priority.

###Seers' Village and Camelot

* [Concept] (http://i.imgur.com/BVw4Zaa.jpg)
* Paused a little due to ‘something we’re announcing at Runefest taking up his time’ but will kick back up soon.
* It is Mod AOB’s secondary project.
* The rework is currently at the stage of moving buildings around and blocking them out.
* We are planning to make Camelot castle larger and built into the mountainside.
* Some unnecessary things, such as the estate agent, will be removed from the village.
* The Seers’ Village Courthouse will be moved into Camelot castle.
* The coal truck mining site will be moved closer to Seers’ Village furnace.
* [Intended layout] (http://i.imgur.com/bPW6ZzX.png).
 * Bank is top middle. 
 * Lodestone would be in roughly the same place. 
 * Bottom-left is a Seers council house.

###God Wars Dungeon Generals

* New models for the GWD1 which were to be part of Expansion #2, which has since been terminated. 
* We want your feedback since we do not want a repeat of the Dagannoth Kings graphical update. 
* Models have been optimised; reduced poly count.
* Models look better in game due to lighting etc.
* New animations.
* Wanted to release it in August.
* [Models:] (https://twitter.com/RuneScape/status/892460219300802560)
 * [Kree'arra.] (http://i.imgur.com/lYTX6Cz.png)
 * [General Graardor.] (http://i.imgur.com/ZtDShvN.png)
 * [K'ril Tsutsaroth.] (http://i.imgur.com/dUWtN0e.png)
 * [Commander Zilyana.] (http://i.imgur.com/L1q2gr9.png)

##Shattered Worlds Improvements

* Now that the anima rates have been buffed we want to add more variance to Shattered Worlds. Add more objectives:
 * Won't always be: Slay X amount of creatures.
 * Sometimes it'll be: Find this thing that we've hidden in the world.
 * Defeat this one particularly powerful monster.
* Hiscores of different types.
* Mini Bosses.
* New Mutators.
* New rewards.
* Adding co-op is not something we are looking at for this project.
* In pre-production; hasn’t moved.
* Will be worked on after Invention Batch II.

#Other Unfinished Business

##Confirmed as Unfinished Business

\#|Content|Notes
-|-|-
1|Floor 61|100%
2|Raids II|
3|Fossil Island|Not so much (while it is UB we didn't put it on the Survey because we want to give OSRS their space to release theirs; if they came out at the same time then everyone would only compare them)
4|Slayer|The top end was not filled/did not have much variety on release. We want to fill 99-120 but don't want every month to feel like a Slayer update

##Top 10 Ninja Fixes

\#|Ninja Fix|-
-|-|-
01|[Bank Rework] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_bank_rework)|Part of UB10.
02|~~Aura Bag~~|~~Changed into the Aura management interface.~~

04|~~Improved Currency Pouch~~|~~Released~~
05|Clan Broadcasts|Not started; much larger task than it seemed and requires engine work.
06|~~Practice Mode (Choose which phase of a boss to practice)~~|~~Investigated but it is a huge task. Will not be done. The things people want is equivalent timewise to developing a completely new boss. Scrapped.~~
07|~~Quick-Prayer Improvements~~|~~Released~~
08|Quick-Chat Current XP|Investigated and it turns out that it is a lot larger than it seemed.
09|Storm of Armadyl Buff|Not Started.
10|Broadcast Interaction (Being able to message someone from broadcasts)|Requires engine work; requires resources given to other higher priority updates.

#Quests, Minigames, and Events

##Needle Skips

* 2018 release.
 * Following feedback, it's a little complicated.
 * Needs a little bit of stuff at the start to help people get on board.
* Mod Osbourne's GameJam project.
* [Worked on by Mod Krista in her TAPP time.] (https://twitter.com/jagexkrista/status/923548957455847424)
* Murder mystery style quest akin to 'One Piercing Note'.
* Will involve only female characters, and will be based around solving the murder of a beloved character.
* Will have a unique mechanic where the player investigates the environment and enters text into a "search engine" interface to receive more clues; this will allow for its events to be played out of sequence.

##Calendar of Events

* Being tested. Release early 2018. ^[05 ^Dec ^2017]
* Will record events such as 
 * Treasure Hunter promotions
 * Official livestreams
 * JMod events.
* Possibly show when your membership expires.
* 'Super events' to notify players of important updates.

#Activities, Minigames, and D&Ds#

* [Livid farm UI improvements and more.] (http://i.imgur.com/L4zOu2m.png)
* [Clan Wars Improvements] (http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/c=j5ZDohXvy0Q/forums.ws?373,374,85,65933377,goto,3)
 * [New and improved rule selection.] (http://i.imgur.com/Y2yT1Nq.png)
 * [Specific war viewer list.] (http://i.imgur.com/8KpeUqB.png)

##Minigame Hub

* Bringing all minigamers into one location.
* Removed some of the more unused minigames.

##[Burthrope Games Room Rework] (https://twitter.com/RSWiki/status/885243874993729536)

* Ability to play games from the Games Room while skilling.
* Initially may only be possible for players on the same world to challenge each other.

#Combat#

##Bosses

###[Hostilius] (https://i.imgur.com/T11MwvS.png)

* Mod Pi has:
 * Brought back bosses like Wildywyrm.
 * Made more event bosses than he can count.
 * Taught everyone how to make a boss.
 * But doesn't have his own signature Mod Pi boss.
 * Working on a boss for TAPP.
 * Wanted someone big from the lore. We've taken down big characters in World Events, Quests but never as a boss.
* Backstory:
 * The most badass demon we have in our lore.
 * Chthonian demon. They get their power from ingesting other demons.
 * Hostilius has ingested more demons than any other.
 * His size could dwarf even a god.
 * Ruled over the infernal dimensions but was eventually overthrown. Zaros tricked him and Zamorak led a rebellion against him.
 * Banished in the abyss.
* You kill him from the inside out:
 * Crashing into the abyss,
 * Jumping onto Hostilius
 * Breaking your way inside his body during the boss fight.
 * Kill him from the inside out.
* Will scale itself to any number of players - solo or group.
* 3 difficulty levels:
 * **Casual mode** - tone things down, aimed at the questers so they don't miss out on the lore we're providing. Will count for reaper or any MQC rewards you need.
 * **Normal mode** - QBD level complexity not Telos.
 * **Hardcore mode** - not Hard mode; will be a step up from hard mode and will be completely merciless. 'I made the combat system. I know it inside out and I will ensure this is the most difficult thing we've ever thrown at you. If i'm not questioning whether or not this thing can be killed on release then i'll make it harder. If any JMod internally can kill it, i'll make it harder. I really want to show you what a Mod Pi boss actually looks like.

##Be Your Own Slayer Master

* Slayer masters will get together and invite you to be a Slayer Master.
* NPCs will come to you for slayer tasks:
 * Ask you what sort of tactics they should employ.
 * Ask you what sort of equipment they should bring.
 * You'll advise them and based on how well you advise them, they'll share some of their XP and loot.
* Some perks of being a Slayer Master:
 * Slayer master store discounts.
 * Chance of not using a VIP ticket.
 * You'll unlock perks in a similar manner to Memorial to Guthix.

##Bounty Hunter Rework

* Part of combat council's plan for next year (not early next year) is to fix BH.
* Mostly strip away all the good rewards and put them elsewhere.

##Raids

* Two years ago we announced Raids II.
* Biggest piece of Unfinished Business that we have in PvM.
* But before Raids II we want to make improvements.

**Raids has some issues. Improvements:**

* Give you a reason to do Raids outside of the lockout.
 * Maybe there's a rare chance of getting Achto at a super-rare rate.
 * Maybe there's a new drop table for when you're farming it over and over.
* We want to increase engagement. Give players a reason to go.
 * The grouping system itself is also an issue. Clunky and hard to get everything going.
 * Potentially move it to the Friends chat system or potentially offer it for both FC and grouping systems.
* Adding a gold version of the Daredevil title. 
 * Requires you to complete every Raid achievement in a single run. 
 * No one in the group can die, or join late, or stand outside, or even bank.
* Lower group sizes so you don't have to get 10 people every time.
* Jellyfish is just an annoying piece of content bridged between Durzag and Yakamaru
 * Give you a reason to do these activities.
 * Maybe the Jellyfish give a rare drop.
 * Maybe gives you a buff to take into the next boss.

##Sirenic and Tectonic Graphical Rework

- [Release for June as part of Elite Dungeons] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/8788y9/sirenic_armour_graphical_update_tectonic_to/dwb090j/)
- [Quite a few armours will be updated.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/8788y9/sirenic_armour_graphical_update_tectonic_to/dwazm8l/)
- [Sirenic armour in-game model.] (https://twitter.com/JagexOrion/status/978225372637663233/photo/1)
- Dyed variants will also be updated.
- [Blood Sirenic is being completely re-texured to match their colours.] (https://twitter.com/JagexOrion/status/978256307714232320)
- ['If we do Malevolent, it'll be much later - Mining and Smithing rework may end up being responsible for that.'] (https://twitter.com/JagexOrion/status/978228932255371264)
- [May have a retro option.] (https://twitter.com/JagexOrion/status/978250003117477889)

##Elite Dungeons

- First Elite Dungeon: Temple of Aminishi
- End of June for the first dungeon
- We have players coming in for a playtest.
- Requirements: Impressing the Locals
 - The third Elite Dungeon has relations to Pieces of Hate but we want it to be accessible so won't add it as a requirement (but will have slight narrative differences for those that have completed it)
- Next week will have a larger stream for it
- [Starting the Dungeon] (https://i.imgur.com/ojyS4q7.jpg)
- The plan is to make the Dungeons work like a miniquests trilogy. A couple of updates in the works are already related to this.
- Story Mode
 - Mobs deal 33% damage
 - Aimed at players who don't thrive in combat environments to experience the content and story. 
 - Has tiny pointless loot. We may even launch with no loot.
- Contains 3 bosses and plan to have 3 in every dungeon for the trilogy for a total of 9 for the trilogy.
- Uses grouping system.
- 1-3 player Moderate PvM challenge; balanced around 3 players being the most efficient
 - GWD2, maybe Araxxor level difficulty for trio
 - Duo gets a bit harder
 - Solo will challenge you quite a bit
 - Difference between solo and trio will be more than just 'we scaled everything by 3'. Trying to be a little more clever about what we do. Mechanics which will be easier to deal with with more people.
 - Expect some players to 'rinse this' as we don't want it to be the next Warden or Inferno
 - You can definitely get carried
- Since you can get carried, we might add a level 10 requirement for getting XP (so skillers don't get combat XP). This is a stretch goal. If you are a skiller and choose to limit yourself, we will not spend too much time designing content around you but we take some consideration into your gameplay style.
- NPCs have an aggro range and a daisy-chain aggro effect. If one sees you, it aggro's all NPCs in their tile range, which in turn applies again etc. Works around corners.
- [Inside] (https://i.imgur.com/YByaDV4.jpg) ;  [Inside II] (https://i.imgur.com/zLPbyYs.jpg); [Inside III] (https://i.imgur.com/RVdjKbk.jpg); 
- [Area 3 of 5] (https://i.imgur.com/rHUVFbs.png) - all 5 areas combined is about the size of Menaphos.
- [Area 2 of 5] (https://i.imgur.com/coEUJij.png) - this and area 5 are the smallest. Still takes a good 5 minutes to traverse, more if you aggro the serpents.
- The second Elite dungeon will be one big dungeon rather than split into 'areas' like the first one.
- NPC behaviour system - NPC will interact with the environment and each other rather than just wandering aimlessly.
 - Using this update as a pilot for this, if it goes well it can be used elsewhere in the game.
 - Means we can make the dungeons at a lot faster pace after this one because of this system. We're already working on dungeon 2 and it should take us half the time.
- Cool mechanics for NPCs that are not bosses: Healers, blockers, stunners, prayer-stoppers, ability to cleave. A lot of players will steamroll through the trash mobs though but that's cool, I like that.
- Minibosses
 - Icons on the minimap
 - May want to take alternative routes in the dungeon just to kill minibosses
- Doesn't use your Dungeoneering gear. Uses your surface world gear.
- Aimed as an alternative Dungeoneering training - awards XP and tokens
 - New reward shop 'Elite dungeon meta shop' with some new consumables and things you'll need for new rewards. 
 - Try to bring Dungeoneering out of the 'minigame skill' stigma. We did a bit with Shifting Tombs but there is no reason why going into any dungeon doesn't give dungeoneering XP.
 - Can farm the Dungeon; no lockout but we are playing with the idea of having some kind of bonus (for example the first dungeon you do every week you get an extra chest) - 
- Ironmen can group with other Ironmen
- Not a safe death
- [Barriers] (https://i.imgur.com/sdVZf8v.png) act as Guardian doors to prevent running past everything
- These bosses are not mechanically similar to Solak or AOD. A bit more mechanical than Dungeoneering bosses. They're simpler and faster to prototype.
- [First boss: The Sanctum Guardian] (https://i.imgur.com/JrpNT45.jpg)
 - [[1]] (https://i.imgur.com/eJkaGU8.jpg) ; [HDR textures] (https://i.imgur.com/VZK0pFn.jpg)
 - 450K HP
 - Definitely Clawdia reimagined 'Fraudia' visually
 - Crassian
 - Related to some of the content this year.
 - Entirely new mechanics
 - Guards the entrance to the inner sanctum of the Temple of Aminishi
 - Probably over 100 NPCs to fight to get to this boss
 - In area 2/5 of the dungeon
- [Second boss: Masuta the Ascended] (https://i.imgur.com/zEH1eqy.png)
 - 600K HP
 - One of the Council of Seven
 - Has a spin attack similar to ROTS
 - Level 1000
 - [Purple fire rain which must be dodged] (https://i.imgur.com/ywXzyd2.png); [Hits you for melee damage before being indicators where purple fire drops] (https://i.imgur.com/k8drBSK.png)
 - [Pulverise attack] (https://i.imgur.com/ZMTx7jO.png)
 - Can hit you for 13k - mechanics in the fight allow you to avoid that + prayers.
 - Drops Masuta's Warspear. Augmentable. Sits between existing tiers so it isn't the T92.
- Third boss: Seiryu the Azure Serpent, Guardian Spirit of Water
 - [Concept] (https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/runescape2/images/6/69/Elite_Dungeon_news_image_3.png/revision/latest?cb=20180413141618)
 - [Concept form II] (https://i.imgur.com/WvmCx7v.jpg) 
 - [In-game] (https://i.imgur.com/6wla6Vk.jpg)
 - [Scale] (https://i.imgur.com/ejXXNex.png)
 - [Scale II: Masuta the Ascended in comparison for size] (https://i.imgur.com/hGTYcQD.jpg)
 - [Another texture of Seiryu which is a spoiler for the fight] (https://i.imgur.com/FZPpHJE.jpg)
 - 7.5m HP
 - Essentially you're getting Seiryu to spit out the corruption rather than trying to kill Seiryu. Then you fight the corruption - pretty difficult to deal with (A-B phased boss fight). The corruption can be seen as the black crystals in Seiryu's spine.
- [Cosmetic outfit which lets you dress as a Sakadagami] (https://i.imgur.com/yFyshdn.png)
- Decent amount of GP/H 
- Uses the Sophanem slayer dungeon loot chest system (with the toggle to drop loot on floor as well)
- What tier are the rewards? 'What I can say is that 92 is a number associated with this update...so is 82 and everything in between but 92 is the number that you guys wanted to hear'
- Next week we will show a video of Shauny dying to the second boss during playtesting.
- [Teleport option on Treasure chests] (https://i.imgur.com/MgBt6BV.png) act as checkpoints throughout the dungeon. When you die you can teleport back to the bosses (after visiting Death's office). Currently your treasure chest loot is taxed if you die like in Sophanem slayer dungeon but your boss loot is unaffected.
- Able to get combat and DG pets.
- Slayer contracts for mobs.
- Avoided having chat dialogues. 
- Achievements and Lore books (collect 20 pieces of an Acolyte's diary)
- We don't want to add the dungeon to a DG daily challenge because we may look to change that system in the future.
- Bosses will be
 - Added to Reaper (Story mode will not count)
 - Boss log (except it's called a Dungeon log)
 - Required for FB and IFB (probably)

###Elite Dungeon II

- Planned for end of July/beginning of August.
- Storyline is a follow on and the narrative is related.
- [Layout] (https://i.imgur.com/bYtxLM7.jpg)
- Lava cavern with three bosses.
- Completing story of Elite DG I gives a hint/clue to what Elite DG II is.
- Not related to 'Elder Gods in a way... I mean not related to Gielinor's Elder Gods. It's probably not what you think it is.'
- [Grey box] (https://i.imgur.com/NqEoonF.png) 'an environment that has been made without any final kits or textures'
- [A '4 map square' section of the minimap for the second dungeon] (https://i.imgur.com/NiBLKLw.png)

* [Mod Daze is working on making Telos colour-blind friendly in his TAPP.] (https://twitter.com/JagexDaze/status/938769963908829185)
* [T99 Prayers + Wrath bug fix] (https://jm.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/7o69on/t99_prayers_wrath/ds7xve5/)

##Combat System Direction

###Weapon Type Diversity

* We've mentioned it before but haven't really done anything about it.
* Things like weapon speed making a difference, weakness system took away Crush, Stab, Slash accuracy.
* This boiled it down to all tiers being the same.
* We want to bring more life to the different types of weapons.
* We made Scythes and Halberds have their unique 1-square addition.
* Spitballing: 
 * What if a dagger randomly didn't proc GCD.
 * What if one-day Javelins may actually be good.
 * Maybe the debate of 'Which are better - Longswords or Rapiers?' can finally be answered. Because right now the answer is obviously Maces because they have a prayer bonus.
* Will add a lot more depth to the weapons.
* Even when we release new weapons you can actually get excited by say a T90 Dagger (instead of just being an alternative to the existing Drygores).

###Better Gameplay for Styles

* When we first made the EOC we worked a lot on something we called 'equivalence'. When we released something for Mage we made sure Ranged/Melee got something 'equivalent' (not the same but equivalent).
* That's how we keep the combat system balanced currently and you aren't too bummed out when you're forced to take a specific style.
* What this has caused is that all the rotations feel very similar.
* We want to make the styles feel a lot more distinct.
* Ramp up the synergies between the abilities. We've done this a little bit but we can really start making you think about your rotations more.
* We've come to the conclusion that giving a style something just for that style is okay. It makes that style interesting and unique in its own way.
* Add effects that fire off randomly which makes you think about your rotations a lot more.
* In order to do this we'll be adding it as rewards from new content.
 * We want the combat system to get more complex as you play the game rather than from the get go.
 * Things like Mutated Dazing Shot / STW. 
* 4TAA
 * What we've traditionally done is we fix the bug/mechanic and then say we balanced the combat system.
 * We have a grand plan - we take what makes 4TAA interesting and we support it in the combat system in a properly balanced way.
 * Take what makes the game fun and build it into the systems for you - each style with its own things for what makes it fun.
 * Don't have it nailed down as to what we'll do as a replacement for 4TAA. Something we're coinsidering is 'spell-weaving'.
 * We won't take away 4TAA and say we'll deal with it later - we'll do both at the same time.
* Start evolving the combat system into something much more interesting. Show you that EOC can be much better for lean forward gameplay.

#Skilling

##The Next 5 Years in Skilling (2023)

* We want to make skilling more exciting, worthwhile, interesting.
* We want to make skilling on a level with combat.
* We will achieve this through:
 * [Diversification of skilling] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_diversification_of_skilling)
 * [Skilling Endgame content] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_skilling_endgame_content)
 * [Skill reworks and a new skill] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_skilling_reworks_.26amp.3B_a_new_skill)
 * [Adding key milestones to skills] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_key_milestones)
 * [Bringing back achievement to skills] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_bringing_back_achievement_to_skills)
 * [Adding more 120 skills to the game] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_adding_more_120_skills)
* These aren't separate. If players want a full rework combined with a 120, for example, we will take that into account.

###Diversification of Skilling
* You shouldn't just choose which skill to train, but *how* to train it.
* There should be different ways to train a skill based on your needs - whether you want XP, GP, AFK etc.
* [Relatively Okay XP, High GP, High Intensity] (https://i.imgur.com/ir01svk.png)
* [High XP, Low GP, High Intensity] (https://i.imgur.com/jZsTNPQ.png)
* [Decent XP, Decent GP, Low Intensity/AFK] (https://i.imgur.com/OTo5Wl0.png)
* [The survey results show us that diversification of skilling is important to the players.] (https://i.imgur.com/d7h4aDE.png)
* [We made a mistake with Waterfall fishing by making it both high XP and low intensity] (https://i.imgur.com/pd3ZwJL.png)
* Runecrafting had this but we feel we've done a lot to fix it and make it more diverse. [We made rune running a viable option again.] (https://i.imgur.com/dW9mAeJ.png)
* Stop segregating players
 * 1-50 players go here; high levels go there etc. 
 * Don't like instanced skilling like arc.
 * We want players, high and low, to be together and interacting.

###Skilling Endgame Content


* Lots of endgame for combat but none of that for skilling.
* Current skilling endgame
 * Jack of all Trades
 * Master Capes
 * Max Cape
* Almost all of it is XP based goals.
* We want to make XP beneficial to you.
* Whether that's in a skilling boss or something else (skilling boss is a controversial topic because what would you do for a skilling boss).
* Potentially the idea of more collection systems. We have pets but they're RNG. We want to add more rewards based on skill.
* Skilling endgame is upto the players to help mould. Help us build what a skilling endgame is.
* Isn't an easy thing to tackle.

###Skilling Reworks & A New Skill

* We want a number of skill reworks in the next five years.
* Release a brand new skill in the next five years (but reworks are a priority)
 * Endless possibilities.
 * We have to really see if what we want from a new skill is not too close to existing content (if Necromancy too close to Summoning; Is Sailing too close to Ports/Arc etc)
 * Not something we rush; has to be thought about in detail.
 * Archeology - Uncovering new content; uncovering a long lost agility course. Finding ancient relics that give you new prayers. The Temple at Senntisten for example.
 * Will follow the rules of diversity.
 * [Ideally within the next couple of years.] (https://i.imgur.com/iZ5eSSF.png)
 * [Players want the new skill to be 'something completely new like Dungeoneering'] (https://i.imgur.com/umWYn4z.png)
 * We want to include the choice aspect (Divination you go from level 1-10 and move on to the next colony. Whereas in Woodcutting there's Willows at 30. Maples at 45. But it's not always best to go to Maples at 45. Some players did Willows until 60 and made some GP at Yews etc).
 * Cross-skilling and how it interacts with other skills. We want cross-skilling to feel natural rather than forced.
* [We know based on the survey that you want old skills to be reworked] (https://i.imgur.com/QflaX7e.png).
* [Players mostly want 1-2 reworks before a new skill] (https://i.imgur.com/hOZkrmo.png).
* Construction Rework
 * Something that comes up a lot.
 * Want to have a rework finished and released by 2023.
 * Could be like Mod Doctor's prototype or something like the Aquarium where you have complete freedom over what goes where in your POH.
 * Give players reasons to go to the POH.
 * Make teleports relevant again.
 * Other skilling within POH much like the Gilded Altar.
* Lots of skills that aren't very useful:
 * Agility
 * Crafting
 * Firemaking
 * Old and outdated.
 * Don't have much of a point to them.
 * Tell us which skills you want to see reworked.
 * Very important that we listen to you

###Key Milestones

* Things like overloads, pack yaks, steel titans.
* [Lots of skills do not have those key milestones and we want to add them.] (https://i.imgur.com/CAbNPmg.png)
* Every skill by 2023 **will** have a key milestone like overloads ('this is an absolute promise.')
* Some ideas
* Firemaking - burn incense for skilling and combat buffs
* Cooking - untradeable food
* Hunter - skill support items
* Firemaking will receive a key milestone in 2018.

###Bringing Back Achievement To Skills

* We want people to be excited about things like skillcapes again; people used to show off their emotes at banks etc.
* Excited about showing off their skilling achievements.
* We want to bring this back.
* [The wow factor in drops for combat] (https://i.imgur.com/Y6Fhddw.png).
* [In comparison to skilling. We want to fill these gaps.] (https://i.imgur.com/i74NTkv.png)
* We want to make skilling worthwhile for making money again (there are existing methods but it isn't enough).

###Adding More 120 Skills

* 120 Slayer didn't go down very well.
* It wasn't populated on the top.
* But we want to talk to you, we want to understand why it went wrong, what players want from 120s and how we can proceed properly with making more 120 skills in the next five years.
* [Majority of people want 120 skills] (https://i.imgur.com/lMuIUkT.png)
* They might not like it because they lose their capes but they are interested in them.
* Most of you are only interested if we do it right and on the right skills.
* Let us know what you want to go to 120; how; and what content 99-120 will entail.
* 120s should be full on launch with no gaps in the skill.
* Skill diversity for 99-120.
* Not saying we'll definitely do it. And by no means are we going to do all skills in five years.
* Needs to be the right skill.
 * If we were to add a new familiar that was better than the steel titan. It'd have to be at 99. The same requirement as the steel titan.
* We want to make it feel like the skill changes for 99-120. At 99 you mastered the skill. You shouldn't feel like you're doing the same menial tasks over and over.
 * New ways to train.
 * New benefits from the skill.

##Magical Relics

* [Concept.] (https://cdn.runescape.com/assets/img/external/news/2017/09/PresImages/5_Skilling_Off_Hands.jpg)
* More off-hand skilling items.
* Each relic has a theme.
 * Sacrifice - damages you in return for even more buffs. Lower your health, bigger the buff. 'Skilling version of Dharok'.
 * Restoration - buffs your skilling potions or regrows locations.
 * Time - To help you AFK more complex training methods.
 * Elemental - Change to Water/Fire/Earth/Air for different buffs.
 * Destruction - Annihilate the resources that you gather in return for alternative rewards.
* Each relic and the [Catalyst Fragment] (http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Combined_Catalyst_fragment) can be augmented with skilling perks.
* Will give a 'skilling outfit group bonus' when using relics with base non-elite skilling outfits.
 * We don't have outfits for certain skills. Firemaking, for example, will apply to the Ring and Gloves from All Fired Up.
  * Full list will be released soon.
* We'll be adding more off-hand skilling items in the future including a special [heroic elven item] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/futureupdates#wiki_hero_items) with some associated lore and quest-like content. Search and recover via some tasks to uncover it.
* Planned to be added to some older pieces of content to enrich their drop tables to give you a reason to return to some neglected areas of RS.

##Brimhaven Agility Arena Rework

* Graphical Rework of the Brimhaven Agility Arena.
* New high level Agility arena.

##[Farming Timer Rework] (http://archive.fo/O1Xld#selection-2065.9-2065.135)

* Mod Easty is doing a full rewrite of the farming code in his TAPP time.
* Includes completely reworking how the farming 'tick' works.
* [Left-click plant interface] (https://i.imgur.com/jP7Vbvy.png) (If you only have one eligible type of seed, it'll also bypass the interface)
* [Examining a patch] (https://i.imgur.com/fBhNBG1.png) (Time remaining until fully grown is if it doesn't get hit by disease)

##Player Owned Farms

- [Concept] (https://i.imgur.com/hefbgeV.jpg)
 - Ignore the goats, we aren't doing goats.
 - Rough mockup although a lot of it will change because it's not how we want it to be laid out.
- Farm will be owned by [Granny Potterington] (https://i.imgur.com/WnbTyfA.jpg)
 - Her husband has passed away, her kids have disappeared and so she's alone and unable to look after the farm.
 - Help out and receive a cut of rewards and profit.
 - You will receive a section of the farm that you will build up and improve.
 - A mixture of construction and farming on the area.
 - Receive a starter pack of animals from Granny P
- Will not be instanced. Everyone will be in the same section of the farm but will only see their own farms.
 - After that animals can come from a variety of different places. Currently a shop, but can be as drops, quest rewards. A lot of reward space here for animals.
- Farm will be the one currently existing in North Ardy that has no purpose.
- Raise animals on the farm, you'll start with something simple such as Rabbits. The rabbits will breed and you can sell them on to make profit. We're looking at an internal farm currency.
- Animals can breed different types
 - One of them is a shiny version. Gives more resources and can be sold for more. Golden fleece for sheep.
 - Strawberry/Vanilla/Chocolate/Shiny are the special Cow breeds. Gives flavoured milk.
- Acquire more paddocks and animals as you progress.
- As animals grow up, you'll be able to keep checking on them and receive XP at certain growth stages. Like checking a tree but at multiple stages. Growth stages XP will stack up so if you haven't checked for three stages, you'll get the XP for all three.
- Will be a chance for disease but we don't want it to be like in plants.
 - Your animal will get sick, and you examine it to find symptoms.
 - Use the symptoms to ascertain which of the limited number of diseases it is
 - Find the cure
 - Cure the animal for farming XP.
 - So it becomes a gameplay aspect rather than being just a punishment
 - Will be able to deter disease through different ways
- Able to sell animals at certain growth stages.
 - Playing with the idea of the 'visiting farmer' - much like yellow runespan wizard but for animals. Rewarded with XP and rewards.
- Mature animals will produce less materials but turn on the 'perkulator' to activate the mature animal's perks. Perks akin to Memorial to Guthix
- Animals don't die of old age. We strawpolled it in Discord and people didn't like that.
- Animals won't stack in the bank because of object variables on them (like Augmented items)
 - We were going to have it so you mouseover and see all the traits on them.
 - We're going to look into naming the animals instead: 'So one called Gertrude, I know what perks she has'. No promises.
- Better to sell the animals or raise them than to store them. You'll only never need to get 2 mature animals of any one type to get a perk anyway.
 - But will still look into storage (other than bank) solutions. No promises. We're already pushing the save file to its limit.
- Animals:
 - Rabbits
 - Cows
 - Chinchompas
 - Chickens
 - Sheep
 - Spiders
 - Yaks
 - Dragons
 - [Mushroom people/Zygomites] (https://i.imgur.com/eyZ4K6b.jpg)
 - Building the system in a way that hopefully makes it easier to add animals in the future
- We were going to add them as pets but to do that we need to add combat animations. We could do just follower pets but the last few times we've made a follower pet people have wanted it overridable. We have quite a lot of content already planned and we don't have the graphics time available to add the animations.
- Animals have stats
 - Health and Happiness
 - Up to 3 traits
 - Weight - potentially 'who can grow the heaviest' competitions
 - Speed - won't have any effect on launch but if Player owned farms goes down well we could potentially make animal races.
 - Attractiveness - won't have any effect on launch but potentially 'beauty' competitions. 
- Want to encourage trading of animals between players. But because of the object variables they can't be placed on the GE. This would create a 'farmer's market' for trading at the farm. Trade them to NPCs or players. 
- Trying to avoid Dailyscape as much as possible but because of the nature of farming it will be a timed activity. We're looking at ways to reduce this so it isn't 'I have to do this X Y Z at a certain time' it's a 'I can come in and meet it at my leisure and still get the same benefits as I would've' and manage when i'm coming back. There's a limit to it, we can only store so much data. Hoping there won't be too much resistance to the 'timed' aspect because farming already has that baked into the skill.
- Also trying to make it so that you can incorporate it into your farming runs. Start on farm > do things on the farm > do farming run > come back to farm and feed the produce of farming run to animals for bonuses > repeat. So you can actually for the first time train farming.
- Magic bean
 - Will be rare. Won't be millions of them in the game.
 - Grows a complete tree instantly
 - Currently the type of tree is random but we're looking to tweak that within a sensible level band
- Ultra compost
 - Better yield chances
 - Better disease protection
 - Receive it from the dung in the farm
 - Storable with Tool Leprechaun
- No HERO item for the update.
- Looking into an elite farming outfit to be earned through the farm
- Haven't gotten into Comp/Trim/MQC reqs but will probably have to do a grace period for it because of the time gate. Dragons for instance will take a long time to reach maturity.

###[Ninja Fixes Survey #1] (http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/a=13/archive.ws?id=1464)

On 30 Oct 2017 a survey went live asking the community which of the following 20 fixes they'd like to see in-game. Each fix required 75% 'yes' votes to pass - with the 'skip' option not counting towards the overall count. 

1. Should Familiarisation reset every Wednesday instead of every 7 days?
- ~~Should we allow you to add a permanent grappling hook to the toolbelt?~~ (released)
* Should we make a different inventory icon that represents full runecrafting pouches?
* Should we display the maximum buy limit of items on the Grand Exchange interface?
* Should we add the ability to empty gem/coal bags and other items into the bank deposit interface?
* ~~When a cannon decays, should we allow you to repair the cannon without picking it up?~~ (released)
* Should Kingdom of Miscellania reset at midnight?
* Should we display an item's guide price on the Grand Exchange search results?
* Should we offer the ability to deposit your items when trying to enter areas with restricted items?
* ~~Should we allow you to re-cast Crystallise on the same target (tree, rock, fishing spot) within the last 5 seconds before it expires?~~ (released)
* ~~Should we create an omni greegree? An omni greegree will consume each of the existing greegrees and let you transform with it.~~ (released)
* ~~Should we allow the Chronicle Absorption Seren prayer to automatically collect manifested knowledge and divine carpet dust?~~ (released)
* ~~Should we add the ability to cut any size granite/sandstone directly into its smallest piece?~~ (released)
* ~~Do you want to be able to use carpets from anywhere in the desert to anywhere else in the desert via an interface similar to the spirit tree?~~ (released)
* ~~Should we recolour all divination wisps and springs to match the energy inventory icon?~~ (released)
* ~~Should we add the ability to customise the left-click option on permanent bonfires, choosing 'Cook at' or 'Add log to'?~~ (released)


###[Ninja Fixes Survey #2] (http://services.runescape.com/m=poll/a=13/archive.ws?year=2018&id=1492)

- Add an all-in-one God Wars soulstone for the four God Wars generals.
- Graphically update the Dagannoth King boss pets to match the model of their larger counterparts.
- Add a permanently open door to the back of Lumbridge Castle kitchen, in a similar position to OSRS.
- Make it so that players on your ignore list are unable to view your online status.
- Make green friend dot take priority over the orange clan member dot when displayed on the minimap.
- Add a 1-use teleport to Prifddinas Waterfall Fishing, sold in Mhistyll's shop.




##Completionist Cape Rework

* Mod Timbo is going to work on having a distinction between the requirements and identity of each othe following:
 * Completionist Cape
 * Trimmed Completionist Cape
 * Master Quest Cape
 * Feats (i.e. just achievements)
* 'We really want to remove the Reaper title from the Completionist Cape so that we can push the difficulty of bosses.'
* Quite a lot of Trim requirements can be made into Comp requirements because they fit it better.
* Taking a look at the stats of the Comp cape, while still having it be desirable.
* [New Varrock and Arc achievements were moved to the 'Misc' category and Mod Stu was required not to make them Comp reqs despite being 'Area tasks' and should count for Taskmaster.] (https://jm.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/7n77ds/is_new_varrock_task_set_a_comp_cape_requirement/drzojz6/) 
 * 'I've been assured that this positioning is temporary until the completionist capes are reworked in the future.'
 * Salty should be a trimmed requirement.

> I hope it'd be to make trim requirements 100% completion, rather than removing [requirements].

> Originally comp was meant to be 100% completion and trim doing that plus insane things like Castle Wars, but that accomplishment seems to have steadily degraded.

##Day/Night Cycles

* An idea we are playing with.
* Taking the weather update promised at Runefest 2016 in a different direction.

##Group Ironman Mode

* Ramen is now working on GIM alongside Solak. 
* Ramen has two weeks off. During this time the group banking engine work should be completed. When he returns Group Ironman mode will begin proper development.
* Group Ironman leaderboards
* Group sizes have been decided but won't be released because it might change
* Would like to have Ironman guild - Mr Ex and other Ironman related things.
* Engine work is completed with the exception of shared banking because of its complexity.
 * Once the engine work for shared banking (i.e. a mutual bank that all players in your party can access) is completed we can actually use it for other pieces of content outside of Group Ironman mode.
* Big project because we want to do it properly (i.e. not just use a scroll on a partner to invite them, want to make a proper system). Hit some bumps in the road but trying to get it out to you without it being released in an incomplete state.
* Confirmed to be released before Mining and Smithing, Mobile and Bank rework.
* Would have loved to have it released in January so people can take advantage of Premier Club but Solak comes first.
* Brand new accounts.
* Work as a team.
* Interact fully with each other:
 * Trading.
 * Playing.
 * Fighting.

##Mod Timbo's Projects

[Mod Timbo tweeted:] (https://twitter.com/JagexTimbo/status/830011808098418689)

> The projects i'm working on right now include increasing the value of seeds, upping Ghostly Essence drops and removing resources from PvM.

###Value of Seeds

* Seed rework/rebalancing is on hold currently but has been progressing.
* Trying to fit the right content to be released alongside it.
* Mod Timbo has six solutions but depends on which content they're attached to.

###Removing resources from PvM

* Not looking to rebalance PvM drop currently.
* Future drop tables will be wary of adding skilling supplies.

##Timed Hiscores

* Seasonals are working better this time around, allowing more players to participate for the top spots.
* [Suggest new seasonal hiscore ideas here.] (http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?74,75,804,65948320)

##Loyalty and Auras

> Conversations about it [auras and loyalty point system] have been going on at Jagex. Specifically, Timbo has made a proposal that would help fix a lot of the current problems we face, not just with Auras, but loyalty points as a whole. It's merely a proposal, and will need further design and overall sign off, however I wanted to let you know that it's something we're treating with a little more urgency that might be coming across from us... [- Mod Sayln.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/70mdif/an_aurable_experience/dn54dgm/)

* Will it be polled? ['Since its loyalty and currency related, balance and proposal may have to be kept in house, but we'll obviously strive to share as much info as we can.'] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/70mdif/an_aurable_experience/dn5aqg7/)
* [No plans to change the time wall to a pay wall.] (https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/70mdif/an_aurable_experience/dn5ajuv/?utm_content=permalink&utm_medium=front&utm_source=reddit&utm_name=runescape)

##Clans

* 'Our biggest ambition is with clans.'
* Likely to do something clan related in 2018.
* So many things a clan can do.
* Clan v Clan stuff at higher levels.
* Clan related content is never negative; it only benefits the community.
* Not looking to do a huge release, but will be released in *steps* (not batches).
* Since a lot of clan-related JMods have moved teams, Mod Shauny has been given more to - clans being one of them.
 * Not looking to do massive clan updates like clan permission reworks.
 * Doesn't want to guarantee anything.
 * Mod Shauny wants to do a clan project for TAPP.

###Clan Avatars

**Needs updating since Moltare's departure from Jagex.**

[Mod Moltare is planning changes to clan avatars.] (http://services.runescape.com/m=forum/forums.ws?16,17,827,65870879)

* Removing the anagogic orts system. Instead clan members will be able to attune to their clan’s avatar habitat for a week.
* Attuned clan members will be able to summon the clan avatar as a companion pet which acts like all other companion pets - familiar override, etc. It’ll have the colours, flag and limb customisation options appropriate to the clan.
* [Currently working with Mod Asherz to make changes to the game engine to allow clan avatars to work with familiar overrides.] (https://twitter.com/moltare/status/835136501621145601)
* Attuned clan members receive a passive XP buff, whether or not they have the avatar pet out.
* While the avatar pet is summoned, in the citadel it will gather resources every few seconds up to a cap shared across all clan avatars (basically the same behaviour as in live, but with a large clan it’ll reach the cap quicker).
* Admin+ ranks with the permissions set can customise the avatars’ appearance at the habitat runestone.
* Admin+ ranks with the permissions set can decide what avatars will gather at the habitat runestone, or stop them gathering.
* This means there’ll be:
 * No more avatar warden shenanigans.
 * No more logging out with the avatar summoned and having to find out where it’s gone.
 * No more ‘recall might bring back your avatar in ten minutes or six hours’.
 * No more orts lying around while you skill making the place look untidy
 * A great big bucket of spaghetti removed from the codebase.
 * It does means that you’ll have to visit your clan’s citadel once a week.
* Aware that citadel skilling is no longer competitive XP rates but revisiting QOL and reward rates is a separate job.
* Additional benefit from using the clan’s home world was something considered but simply is not practical.
* Aware that a small number of people are very attached to the Heal Over Time buff…not staying on the avatar in the new incarnation, but I'll seek to bring it back in future by some other clan-gathered-as-group means. Only a very small % of players used this buff to begin with.

####**XP Buff**

* Clan avatars are largely just an XP buff. Some things to take into account:
 * A clan XP buff should not reward clans with finer citadels LESS than those with more basic citadels (ie it should be MORE or THE SAME).
 * A clan XP buff should not reward players MORE for having a particular clan rank.
 * A clan XP buff should not reward players who work for their clan LESS than those who do not.
 * We're committed to doubling this amount as a temporary (generally one month long) bonus to clans who have won or come second in a clan cup; this is the same behaviour as is currently live.
 * The analytics data shows that remarkably few people actually skill together to get the 6%.
* Which leads to a couple of potential approaches:
 1. The XP buff is 3%. This means, essentially, keeping the same buff most of you already have (unless you're currently a warden) but simplifying the delivery.
 2. The XP buff consists of 3%, plus an extra 2% if their fealty is at maximum (max 5%). This means players are rewarded for working for their clans.
 3. The XP buff consists of 1% per tier of the clan's habitat, plus an extra 2% if their fealty is at maximum (max 5%). This means players are rewarded for working for their clans, and that players are incentivised to build their citadel up.
* At the moment Mod Moltare is leaning towards (2), which seems the most straightforward way to fairly reward clan engagement without requiring that people join only larger clans. 
* "How about 1% per fealty extra, to a maximum of 6%, instead of 2% for max fealty?"
Got no issue with this on a technical or design basis. I'll see if I can persuade Timbo to let me give that additional 1% total, although I already had to defeat him in a Shokugeki to get the 5% so this might come to pistols at dawn.

> Enhancers definitely need changing, however this is something **that will happen at a later date**... My idea is to make Enhancers "variables" on your account, basically meaning when you are given a Castle Wars Enhancer for example, you can "crush" it and it applies the effects to your person, without the need to carry it around with you. You will have the option to not crush the enhancer if you would prefer to not get the reward until a later date. Of course there is *no promises* here, this is just an idea...

##Witch's House Graphical Rework

Re-adding the examines which were removed aren't a priority and would have to be ninja-fixed in.

* Tick-manipulation methods:
 * We don't purposely put in tick-manipulation methods.
 * It adds intensity but not in a way we designed it to be
 * Is a perfect example of high intensity for high reward.
 * We want to add more of to high intensity methods but just not 'accidentally'
