* **Description:** The reddit FC was created when the username cleanup happened in August 2014, moderator of /r/runescape /u/kolumbz sniped the name "Reddit" and used it to open a friends chat due to multiple issues with the then main friends chat "Reddit FC".

* **RS3 and OSRS are welcome**, although it is **recommended** to use reddit OSRS friends chat [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/2007scape/wiki/cc_rules) if you are playing OSRS.

##FAQ

1. Can I have a rank?

General rank is only given to subreddit moderators and Captain is given to those who are deemed trustworthy enough to have kicking privileges, this trust is gained through contributing to the chat and being a regular user (you can also be recommended by other ranks). No other ranks are given out.

2. Can I have a smiley?

Reddit is a personal main account of /u/kolumbz and therefor does not want to give out smileys to everyone as the friends list is limited to only 400 users. Although if you are helpful in the FC you usually end up being given a smiley rank.
