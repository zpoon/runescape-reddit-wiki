#Phishing

This is a brief guide on identifying phishing emails and links.

##Emails

* Emails from Jagex will always address you by your in-game display name. For example: "Dear Cpt Metaphor." Emails from Jagex will never address you with a generic title such as "Dear Player" or "Dear Customer"

* Jagex will never ask you to challenge or appeal an offence on your account - if they actually have evidence that you were botting, goldfarming, RWTing, or account trading, they will simply ban you, and they will ignore your appeal.

* Jagex is not suing you. Binding legal notices are always delivered by certified mail, never by electronic communication.

* The appearance of the "From:" email address can be spoofed by someone with sufficient technical know-how, and is not conclusive proof that an email came from Jagex.

* Links in emails can be disguised, and may not actually go where they appear to. For example, this link goes to YouTube: [http://runescape.com](http://youtube.com)

##In-game

* Jagex Moderators will always have a gold crown icon next to their name in all chats, and will always have a name that starts with "Mod". Anybody claiming to be with Jagex who does not have a gold crown icon next to their name, and whose name does not start with "Mod", is an impostor who should be reported for Jagex Staff Impersonation.

* Jagex will never offer you Player Moderator status through private in-game messages. If you have been selected to be a Player Moderator, you will be notified via the Message Centre in the game lobby.

* If you see people in-game advertising giveaways on YouTube, report them for macroing and/or advertising websites. The giveaway videos that they advertise always lead to phishing sites.

* Do not reveal your original display name to people claiming to be old friends - this piece of information is the first thing someone needs to try to recover your account.

##Reddit

* Jagex Moderators have a gold crown flair. We recommend keeping subreddit CSS on for this reason. (Anybody pretending to be a JMod without the flair should be reported to the subreddit moderators.)

* Known phishing sites are blacklisted on /r/runescape using AutoModerator. If you do see a phishing link, please report it immediately so that the subreddit moderators can add it to the blacklist.

* Jagex will never send you links via reddit private message. If you receive a private message on reddit, report them to the admins by going to /r/reddit.com clicking "message the moderators"

##Other

* You will never need to log in to view RS Forums content.

* Jagex Moderators cannot hide forum content for people not logged in.

* Links to the forums will never result in an immediate popup for logging in.

* If you have been granted access to specialist forums, such as the High-Level Forums, Fansite Forums, or Player Moderator Forums, clicking a link to these forums without being logged in will not result in an immediate login popup, but rather being redirected to the top-level forums page.
