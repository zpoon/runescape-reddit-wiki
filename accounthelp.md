# Jagex/RuneScape Account Help

> **Last updated 25 March 2018**

On /r/runescape we cannot help you with any account issues such as bans, mutes, hacks, or billing. The subreddit moderators do not have any affiliation with Jagex, and the JMods who browse /r/runescape are community management, not account support or customer service. All users requesting account help are directed to this page.

**Under NO circumstances should you provide sensitive information such as passwords, PINs, account history, or billing information to ANYONE on this website, including moderators, admins, and users. Jagex will never ask for this information outside of official channels of communication (this subreddit or reddit as a whole is not an official channel of communication). Be smart with your private information.**

**If you require Player Support assistance then most people get the help they need for account issues by using the [RuneScape Support](https://jgx.game/Support-) website - give it a try!**

You can also take a look at our [tips for account help](https://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/wiki/accounthelptips) which features short to the point tips on various account help problems.
