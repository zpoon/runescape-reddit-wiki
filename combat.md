##Introduction

This article serves as an overview of the major combat overhaul known as the Evolution of Combat, or "EoC." This article is intended to reflect the game as it currently is, rather than at original release, so some points below may not have actually been implemented on the date of the EoC update.

For an in-game tutorial of the combat system, and to practice using it, speak to Lady Deathknell at the [Lumbridge Combat Acadamy](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Combat_Academy)

##Main changes to combat

* Abilities added. There are different abilities for Melee, Ranged, Magic, Defense, and Constitution. Abilities can be performed in addition to regular auto-attack damage. Some abilities require certain types of equipment, like a two-handed weapon, or a shield. Some abilities are learned as quest rewards or boss drops. More on these later.

* The Special Attack bar has been replaced with Adrenaline (and Special Recover potions were changed into Adrenaline potions). Some abilities add Adrenaline, others drain it. Traditional "special attacks" will consume a large amount of Adrenaline.

* Equipment stats now determined purely by level and class. For example, a Chaotic Rapier and Chaotic Longsword are exactly the same except for stab vs. slash. There is no reason to use equipment below whatever is best for your level, if you can afford it.

* Off-hand weapons added. If you're looking to deal maximum damage, you'll want the offhand version of whatever your main hand weapon is. Off-hand weapons are obtained the same way that their main-hand partner is. For example, offhand chaotic weapons are bought from the Dungeoneering rewards trader.

* Monster weaknesses are now meaningful. Weaknesses are now part of the core combat mechanics, and should always be considered - using the correct combat class (ex. Ranged) will give a large accuracy boost, and using the correct sub-class (ex. bolts) will give a larger accuracy boost. Many monsters weaknesses changed with the EoC update, to provide variety instead of everything being weak to a chaotic rapier.

* Armor has a single defensive stat (in addition to the life point boost), instead of different stats for different types of incoming attacks. The equipment's combat class determines how much of that armor stat is applied to different classes of incoming attacks. More on this below.

* Nex and Port armors give a lifepoints boost. Additionally, banks will rapidly heal players to full health.

##Armor

* There are three types of armor: Tank, Power, and Hybrid.

 * Tank armor provides the best defensive stats for its level and combat class. (Most armor level 60 or below falls into this category, along with Barrows equipment and the newer [Player-owned Port armor sets](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Player-owned_port/Rewards#Armour))

 * Power armor offers reduced defense (-5 levels) and lifepoints (-10 levels) in exchange for a damage boost stat. (God-wars armors and Nex armors are Power-type)

 * Hybrid or All-class armor also has reduced defense and lifepoints (-15 levels for both), but provides equal protection against all three combat styles. ([Obsidian armor](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Obsidian_armor#Armour) and the four [Warpriest](http://runescape.wikia.com/wiki/Warpriest_armour) armor sets are Hybrid-type)

* Several new sets of armor were added to fill in level gaps, especially for lower-level Ranged and Magic armors.

* The single armor rating is applied in varying amounts to different types of attacks: the full amount against the weaker side of the combat triangle, 2/3 against the same side, and 1/3 against the stronger side^(1). For example, a Bandos Chestplate has 298 Armor Rating and is Melee class. The full 298 Armor is applied to incoming Ranged attacks, 199 Armor is applied to incoming Melee attacks, and 100 Armor is applied to incoming Magic attacks.^(1)

* For Hybrid armor, the full armor rating is applied to all three classes of incoming attacks.^(1)

* Player-worn armor no longer distinguishes between stab/slash/crush (or any other sub-class for that matter).

* Items in the torso, legs, and shield slots will *always* negatively affect the accuracy of wrong-style weapons. For example, it's no longer a good idea to wear Ranged-class Karil's armor while meleeing.

* Equipped degradable items which fall into your grave on death (i.e. if worn but not protected on death) will lose 20% charge, or 10% if the item degrades to dust.

^^(1) ^(This is not, strictly speaking, true, but it is a close enough approximation of the actual combat equations.)

##Weapons

* As mentioned above, there are now off-hand weapon variants.

* Off-hand weapons have 50% of the damage of their main-hand equivalent.

* 2-handed weapons have 150% of the damage of a same-level 1-handed weapon.

* Magic staffs are now 2-handed weapons. Wands and orbs/books have been added for dual-wielding mages.

* Claws have been split into main-hand and off-hand items.

* Longbows have been turned into Shieldbows - a bow with a shield, with stats equivalent to a 1-handed weapon plus a same-level shield. Shortbows are still normal 2-handed weapons.

* The four godswords and the Enhanced Excalibur have an option to use their special effects as passive buffs rather than special attacks. EE is an off-hand weapon.

* Barrows set effects and other passive effects activate on autoattacks only, not on Abilities.

* Taking advantage of class and sub-class weaknesses will grant you bonus accuracy on nearly all non-boss monsters. By the same token, using the wrong side of the combat triangle may result in a severe accuracy penalty.

 * Melee sub-classes: Stab, Slash, Crush

 * Ranged sub-classes: Arrows, Bolts, Thrown

 * Magic sub-classes: Air, Water, Earth, Fire

* For the purposes of determining sub-class while using Ancient Magicks, Smoke=Air, Shadow=Earth, Ice=Water, Blood=Fire.

* Ability attacks do not use up ammunition or runes.

* Equipped degradable weapons which fall into your grave on death (i.e. if worn but not protected on death) will lose 20% charge, or 10% if the weapon degrades to dust.

##Prayers and Curses

* Ranged and Magic equivalents of Turmoil have been added (Anguish and Torment, respectively).

* Augury and Rigour are unlocked from the Knight Training Grounds along with Piety, and do not need to be bought from the Dungeoneering rewards trader.

* On the standard prayer book, newly unlocked prayers automatically replace lower-level versions (ex. Steel Skin replaces Thick Skin)

* Protection/Deflection prayers only protect 50% (Except for TzTok-Jad and TokHaar-Jad; that's still 100% because the fight was originally designed for prayer-switching)

##Abilities and Adrenaline

* There are 3 types of Abilities: Basic, Threshold, and Ultimate.

 * Basic Abilities: Add 8% adrenaline

 * Threshold Abilities: Require at least 50% adrenaline to use, and drain 15% adrenaline

 * Ultimate Abilities: Require 100% adrenaline to use, and drain adrenaline down to 0%.

* Adrenaline will start to slowly decrease if the player is out of combat for too long

* Adrenaline will instantly drain to 0% when attacking a new target in the Wilderness.

* Eating food or using a combat familiar scroll will drain 10% adrenaline. (Potions do not drain adrenaline.)

* Some abilities require a two-handed weapon, dual-wielded weapons, or a shield.

* For more information on Abiliites, and to practice using them, visit the Combat Acadamy in Lumbridge, and talk to Lady Deathknell to do the combat tutorial.

* In general, combat is less about point-click-wait-for-it-to-die, and more about moment-by-moment decision making. For example: is right now a good time to use a multi-target ability? Should I use adrenaline on a damage-dealing Ultimate, or a healing Ultimate? Should I use a stun prevention ability now, or save it for later?

##PvP and the Wilderness

* PvP XP is awarded according to the damage you dealt, either 1) when an opponent dies, or 2) when you die, for your un-slain opponents.

* Adrenaline instantly drains to zero when attacking a new target in a dangerous PvP setting. This is to prevent people from building up adrenaline, then opening a fight with an Ultimate ability.

* Multi-way combat zones are now clearly marked.

* In High-Risk Wilderness worlds, the use of the Protect Item prayer or curse is disabled within the wilderness, and Signs or Portents of Item Protection are also disabled.
