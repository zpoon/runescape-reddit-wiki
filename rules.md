#Rules and Guidelines of /r/runescape 

##Subreddit rules - Rigidly Enforced

* Do not submit posts that break, or promote breaking the [Runescape Terms and Conditions](http://www.jagex.com/g=runescape/terms/terms.ws) or the [Rules of Runescape](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Rules_of_RuneScape).

* General discussion on the topics of Bots and Private Servers is permitted, however any post that directs users (by links or names) or promotes these services will be removed.

* Do not submit posts for buying/selling/sharing/giving away of Runescape/Jagex accounts, gold and services.

* URL shorteners are not permitted e.g. bitly, goo.gl, is.gd.

* RuneScape tools/programs posted to the subreddit should contain the source code; if the post does not contain the source code and is not from a known trusted source, it will be removed.

 * You should be cautious of malicious/rogue applications/tools posted on the subreddit, it would be best to wait until other users have verified that the source code is safe to compile and run. 

* Do not negatively target a single player/user.

 * Posts that involve a highly publicised event will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. 

 * Censor the name(s) of the users you wish to give example of; otherwise the post will be removed.

 * /r/runescape isn't the right place to post users you suspect are breaking the rules/botting etc. These posts will be removed.

* Don't spam your personal blog, stream, or YouTube Channel.

 *  Links to YouTube and livestreams by users that have not participated in community discussions will be removed automatically.

* The /r/runescape moderators, and the JMods who browse this subreddit, cannot help you with account issues. This includes bans, mutes, locks, hacks, billing, and rollbacks.  Instead of posting about it here, check [here](/r/runescape/wiki/accounthelp) for the official methods of contacting Jagex to resolve these issues. 

* Abusive trolling is not allowed
 * If a user posts in a topic purposely to disrupt/annoy users by using abusive terminology and does not contribute towards to the discussion the user will be banned from the subreddit.

* Do not ask for charity.

* No Treasure Hunter Reward Posts
 * Any posts that share rewards received on treasure hunter will be removed, discussion on Treasure Hunter/MTX is allowed.

##Additional guidelines - Subject to Moderator Discretion

* Please use a [spoiler flair](http://puu.sh/9c0JB/d641a75e5a.png) on all quest-related content for the first 48 hours after quest release.

* Avoid [Fixed] posts e.g. when a user posts an image but you think it needs correcting for factual or comical effect and you then proceed to post the corrected image in a new topic/post by adding [Fixed] to the start of the title. You can post the new image as a comment within the original post. 

* If you want to advertise your clan, utilize the clan list [here](/r/runescape/wiki/clans).

* Crop your images, here is a tutorial on how to crop images using [Microsoft Paint]( http://windows.microsoft.com/en-gb/windows7/crop-a-picture-using-paint) and on a [Mac]( http://www.noproblemmac.com/blog/2013/03/11/preview-the-fastest-way-to-crop-an-image-on-your-mac/)

* Content should be RuneScape-related in some way more substantial than the title of the post.

* Memes are allowed in moderation.

* This is not a trading forum; do not advertise trade offers here.

* Links to third-party gaming referral sites or giveaway sites are not permitted. Since these sites solicit personal information, posting links to them breaks the [Rules of Runescape](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Rules_of_RuneScape).

 * Giveaways or asking for items or membership is not allowed.
