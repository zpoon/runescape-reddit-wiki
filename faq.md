###Why isn't this item trading anywhere near GE price?

The starting GE guide price of new items is (somewhat arbitrarily) chosen by Jagex on release day. For many items, the starting price almost never reflects the actual value of the item as determined by basic supply and demand economics. The GE guide price can only change by up to 5%/day, so it can take a while for the GE guide price to adjust to accurately reflect reality. It will take even longer if the item has low trade volume (i.e. not many traded on GE per day). Do not trust the GE guide price on items that were released within the last 2-4 months, or longer for items that are more expensive/rare and thus have lower trade volume.

For example, with the Seismic Wand, it took over a year for the GE guide price to match the items's actual value, with the guide price and actual value approaching the meeting point from opposite directions.

###I found bots in-game. What should I do?

In 2013, Jagex rolled out BotWatch, an advanced piece of software aimed at detecting and eliminating bots. BotWatch is a learning system. It uses in-game macroing reports to learn to identify new types of bots, then systematically bans all bots of that type.

In order to learn about new types of bots, though, it needs those player reports. Therefore, the best thing to do is to simply report the bots and move on.

##Account/Website Questions

###I need help recovering my account!

If you are having problems recovering your account, read the [Account Help](http://services.runescape.com/m=rswiki/en/Account_Help_Contact_Us) section of RuneScape and watch Jagex's video on [Password Recovery](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0WOs1VtBB2A). 

---

###Can I recover my account without access to the registered email?

No! If you could do that, then so could anybody else.

---

###Can I recover my account if I don't remember the original login name?

You can try filing an account recovery ticket in the support centre, but unless you know past and original passwords, location and date of account creation, and other detailed information, then trying to recover an account without the original login name is functionally equivalent to trying to steal an account.

Set up [RuneScape Authenticator](https://secure.runescape.com/m=totp-authenticator/landing), and then you can disable JAG.

###Oh my god! Jagex is suing/banning me and I haven't done anything wrong!

It's a [phishing email](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CG2LMw6WR-Y), you can report it and ignore it.

---

### I was banned or hacked. Help me!

Unfortunately, we can't. The subreddit moderators have zero affiliation with Jagex, and the JMods who browse /r/runescape work in community management, not account services. However, you can [click here](/r/runescape/wiki/accounthelp) to see the official methods for contacting Jagex to get such issues resolved.

---
###I logged in to find my name changed to [#12345ABCDE] (or similar).

Jagex periodically releases the display names on inactive accounts. You will need to choose a new display name.

---

###Why is there an advertisement for real-world trading websites on runescape.com? Is Jagex promoting rule-breaking?  (Also: why is there an advertisement for RWT on reddit?)

Jagex does not directly choose whose advertisements are displayed. They simply rent out page space to a third-party advertising provider, who selects an advertisement to display based on your internet history and what website you're currently on. Since you play Runescape and you're looking at the Runescape website, you're very likely to see Runescape-related advertising. Sadly, this includes advertising for services that break the rules. Jagex can blacklist such advertisements with their advertising provider to prevent it from being shown on their website, so be sure to report rule-breaking advertisements.

Advertising on reddit is automatically selected in a similar fashion. Subreddit moderators do not select the advertising on their subreddit. Be sure to report rule-breaking advertisements.

##Technical Questions

###My antivirus is blocking RS from running. What do I do?

This is a very common problem among users of Avast. (Although technically any antivirus could incorrectly block RS, it's almost always Avast that does it.) Solution is [here](http://www.reddit.com/r/runescape/comments/23zd3q/known_issue_antivirus_software_blocking_runescape/).

##Reddit Questions

###How do I get Trimmed Completionist Cape flair?

You can get one by [messaging the moderators](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Frunescape). Please include a screenshot which features your Trimmed Completionist Cape and you saying your reddit username in-game.

Max Cape and (untrimmed) Completionist Cape flairs used to require screenshots for proof, but these flairs are now publicly available.

---

###How do I get holiday flairs such as partyhats or h'ween masks?

These flairs are only available during their respective holidays.

---

###What about other flairs that I've seen?

Certain other flairs may be from a subreddit-hosted contest, or some other limited availability event. Ask the user for more info!

Note that most (but not all) unique custom flairs (on non-moderators) date back to the original moderating team. Since then, /r/runescape has exploded in popularity and it would simply be too much work to offer custom flairs to anybody who wanted one.

---

###Someone PM'd me a phishing link. What should I do?

First, take a screenshot of the message and send it to us (click "message the moderators" in the sidebar) so that we can add the phishing link to our domain blacklist. Then, [send a message to /r/reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Freddit.com) to bring it to the attention of the reddit admins.

---

### If I have an issue, can I PM individual mods?

Moderation-related discussion will not be carried out in private messages. Instead, click the "message the moderators" button in the sidebar to send modmail, which is visible to all subreddit mods.

##Common Game Suggestions
**(and why they can't be implemented)**

>Mounts or anything else that would increase movement speed

Everything in RS moves at one of three speeds: Crawl (1 square per 2 game ticks), Walk (1 square per 1 game tick), and Run (2 squares per 1 game tick). This is a core game mechanic that would be extremely difficult and time consuming to change. Since the player can already move at Run speed, there is no additional speed benefit to be gained from mounts.

Certain things like Agility level and equipment+inventory weight indirectly affect overall movement speed by affecting Run Energy drain and/or recharge rate.
