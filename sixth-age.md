##The History of Gielenor

###The First Age

Very little is known about the First Age, as it ended thousands of years ago.

Guthix and Seren discovered Gielenor, and brought various races to it, including humans and elves.

Guthix found and used The Catalyst (an Elder artifact, also called The Stone of Jas) to create the magic of Gielenor, allowing the sentient races to practice the magical arts.

When Guthix saw that people were worshipping him as a god (contrary to his wishes), Guthix decided to go sleep, deep underground, to remove his influence from the world. This marked the end of the First Age, after about 4000 years.


###The Second Age


After Guthix went to sleep, other gods arrived on Gielenor, establishing territories, gaining followers, and introducing new races to the land. More gods existed on Gielenor in the Second Age than today - many of them have been slain since then.

The dominating deity of the Second Age was Zaros, whose empire was the greatest civilization to ever exist on Gielenor - both in terms of size and technological advancement. It was, however, not the most pleasant place or time to live, as humans were often viewed as the playthings of more powerful races and gods.

During this time, The Siphon (an Elder artifact, also called The Staff of Armadyl) - fell into the hands of of the mahjarrat Zamorak, one of Zaros's generals. Zamorak rebelled against Zaros, used The Siphon to steal his power, and exiled him. Zamorak ascended to godhood, but was promptly banished from Gielenor by the other gods.

Some time later, Zamorak returned, having amassed a huge army of followers, and declared war on the other gods.

There is no definitive mark to the end of the Second Age. The Second Age can be considered to have ended anywhere between Zamorak's rebellion and his return with his army.

###The Third Age

As mentioned above, Zamorak returned with a massive army, and declared war on the other gods. This began the God Wars - a devastating and unending conflict between Zamorak, Saradomin, Armadyl, and Bandos, with Zarosians trying to hold on to their former glory. Alliances between gods were formed and broken. Destruction spread throughout Gielenor. The once-fertile land of Forinthry was laid to waste by battle, becoming an empty, barren land now known as The Wilderness.

During the war, many major civilizations and races were eradicated, including the Zarosian Empire. With Zaros gone and most of his followers imprisoned or in hiding, Zaros fell into obscurity and was forgotten by all but a few loyal followers or historians.

At one point, armies of the five warring factions did battle in an icy underground dungeon. Nex, the extremely powerful Zarosian general, was imprisoned within the dungeon by the other four factions working together in a temporary alliance. The armies in the dungeon, however, were trapped and frozen inside. This dungeon would eventually thaw and be known as the God Wars Dungeon, but not until the Fifth Age.

The Zamorakian vampyres, under the command of Lord Draken, took over the formerly Zarosian land of Hallowvale (now Morytania). Saradominist warriors from Mithsalin began a crusade to reclaim Hallowvale from the vampyres. The crusade was led by six promising brothers who had been given mystically enhanced armor and weapons by a mysterious figure (the mahjarrat Sliske). The crusade initially was successful, with the Saradominist forces reclaiming large areas of desecrated land. However, as the crusade neared its end at Darkmeyer, Draken's capital city, Sliske appeared again, took back his magical gifts, and bound the brothers to his service. At the next battle, the six brothers were mortally wounded, and died. They were buried in barrows outside the walls of Darkmeyer, and the crusaders fled back to their home. And so they came to be known as the six Barrows Brothers: undead, nearly immortal, very powerful, and eternally bound to Sliske.

The God Wars lasted four thousand years, until the sheer degree of destruction awoke Guthix from his slumber. Guthix put an end to the God Wars, plunging his sword into the ruined land of Forinthry and banishing the gods from Gielenor. Guthix established his Edicts, which consisted of warning the gods to stay out, and threatening to destroy and remake Gielenor if they did not comply. Most of the major gods complied, but Seren chose instead to shatter her crystal form in order to stay with her elves. Most minor gods, who were not powerful enough to be affected by the Edicts, were allowed to stay on Gielenor.

The end of the God Wars and the establishment of the Edicts marked the end of the Third Age.

###The Fourth Age

In general, the main theme of the Fourth Age was rebuilding. Much of the current territorial boundaries were established during this time.

Humans attempted (unsuccessfully) to recolonize the Wilderness. Many humans had abandoned civilization and lived in tribes, but a few human cities survived to the end of the Fourth Age. These are the same human cities on the map today.


The vampyres, still led by Draken, completed their takeover of Hallowvale (now Morytania). In response, Saradominist priests blessed the River Salve to prevent vampyres and werewolves from being able to cross it without being severely weakened.

The elves ruled over much of what is now Kandarin, until infighting with a Zamorakian elf clan caused their kingdom to shrink back to the Tirannwn region.

Gnomes returned to the surface to find their settlements destroyed. They faced extinction from human barbarian tribes and were forced to hide. Eventually, the Grand Tree was planted and gnome civilization began to thrive.

Dwarves found a huge underground cavern, and built the city of Keldagrim. They found their magical abilities dwindling, and were forced to develop and rely on technology. As a result, dwarven engineering shot far ahead of anyone other race's technology.

Goblins had difficulty finding a place to live in Kandarin, being squished between ogres to the south and gnomes to the north. Between external threats, infighting, and other problems, goblins became weaker and less intelligent. Eventually, they spread to other regions and found places to build crude but permanent settlements.

Cave goblins remained underground, cut off from all external influence. Their development of technology and magic grew during this time.

The TzHaar, having been in isolation since the First Age, made first contact with surface people, but regarded humans as pets.

Humans discovered rune essence, and discovered Runecrafting. This marked the beginning of the Fifth Age.

###The Fifth Age

With runes now in plentiful supply, humans were able to defend themselves effectively against the more dangerous races of Gielenor. Humanity rapidly gained supremacy throughout Gielenor, except for the hostile Morytania region and the lost forests of the elves.

Saradominism became the dominant religion, and the Saradominist church gained massive political and cultural influence.

Human kingdoms prospered greatly through the use of runes, until an attempt to perfect teleportation spells backfired, destroying the Wizards' Tower and all of the magical research and information that it contained. The art of runecrafting was lost, and Zamorakian wizards were blamed for the disaster.

For the next hundred years, humanity continued to prosper, but those in the magical community knew that the supply of runes was ever-dwindling. Anticipating the exhaustion of runes, scientists and alchemists advanced society through other, non-magical means. During this time, foreign ideas from the resurfaced civilizations of the TzHaar, the dwarves, and the cave goblins, gained a foothold, and Saradominist influence steadily eroded.

In the meantime, the cavern known as the God Wars Dungeon thawed out, and the inhabitants continued their battle, unaware that the God Wars had ended. The mahjarrat Sliske tricked a group of Guthixian druids into performing a ritual to re-open Nex's prison within the dungeon, allowing her to partake in battle once again. This battle was contained to the icy dungeon, and did not affect the outside world.

Near the end of the Fifth Age, runecrafting was re-discovered by the Player, and human supremacy was re-secured throughout Gielenor.

In a rare display of altruism, the ogre shamans shared their mystical secrets with humans, leading to human practice of Summoning.

A Strange Power was felt throughout Gielenor. This was later determined to have been caused by the death of the mahjarrat Bilrach, who was trying to bring back Zamorak. The Strange Power lead to the discovery of the extensive Daemonheim dungeons, and the development of the Dungeoneering skill.

The player helped lead an assassination of Lord Draken, ending his rule of Morytania. Vanescula Draken assumed his position, and the full ramifications of this are yet to be seen.

The player found the current hiding place of The Catalyst, discovered the Dragonkin who guard it from misuse, and prevented the mahjarrat Lucien from using The Catalyst and The Siphon to ascend to godhood.

The player also discovered that the TzHaar descended from an even more ancient race known as the TokHaar, and that The Kiln in which the Tokhaar reside is an Elder artifact, capable of creating other Elder artifacts.

The end of the Fifth Age was marked by the events of The World Wakes quest.

##The World Wakes

In this quest, Guthix's resting place is discovered by the player. All five of the generals from the God Wars Dungeon descended upon upon Guthix's cave, each with their own motives, and each backed by numerous followers.

At various points throughout the cave, the player must defend himself from several God Wars generals, fend off attacks from the mahjarrat Enahkra and Zemouregal, and hold back an army of Saradominist troops.

After unlocking the final door to Guthix's chamber, the Player is infused with a mysterious power by Guthix himself. 

The mahjarrat Sliske is the first one to reach Guthix, uses The Siphon to mortally wound Guthix, and vanishes. Injured, Guthix shared his history with the Player, and tells the Player that they have been blessed and are now the World Guardian, entrusted with protecting Gielenor from the gods. As World Guardian, the Player is now able to resist, neutralize, or cancel any form divine magic. After sharing this, Guthix dies.

With Guthix gone, his Edicts - which keep the other gods away from Gielenor - are no longer in effect. The gods are free to return.

Saradomin immediately appears, and forcibly teleports away the Zarosian and Zamorakian forces. However, his power does nothing to the World Guardian.  The player learns that Saradomin is in possession of another Elder artifact: the Crown Archival, which can be used to find other Elder artifacts (but also allows those in possession of other Artifacts to find the Crown).

The death of Guthix (and the end of his Edicts) mark the end of the Fifth Age, and the beginning of the Sixth. At this point, the game transitions from Year 169 of the Fifth Age, to Year 1 of the Sixth Age.

##The Sixth Age

Guthix's divine essence has scattered across Gielenor, in the form of divine wisps. These wisps can be harvested for energy and memories, and the discovery of the wisps lead to the development of the Divination skill. 

Zamorak finally returned to Gielenor via the Rift at the bottom of Daemonheim. He found an unusually large deposit of divine energy and attempted to harvest it to empower himself, but was stopped by Saradomin. This started the Battle of Lumbridge (World Event 1: The Battle of Lumbridge). Saradominist and Zamorakian forces, aided by players, attempted to gather divine shards to empower their respective god. Ultimately, Saradomin proved victorious, defeating Zamorak and taking the divine energy deposit for himself.

Some time later, Sliske gathered all of the main gods together. Claiming to be in possession of The Catalyst, Sliske promised to give it to whoever slays the most gods. This set in motion a conflict between gods (World Event 2: The Bird and the Beast). Bandos erected a divine energy cannon. Opposing him in the name of justice, Armadyl set up his own divine cannon. Each side sent out convoys to gather divine energy, with the help of players. Armadyl was able to power up his cannon first, killing Bandos.

The World Gate - the portal through which all races originally entered Gielenor - was rediscovered by the Zarosian mahjarrat Azzanadra. With help from the World Guardian and from Sliske, the World Gate was reactivated for travel to the mahjarrat homeworld of Freneskae, where the World Guardian found Zaros, weak and in exile, and helped him return to Gielenor. 

Following the death of Bandos, all his follower races traveled to the goblin homeworld of Yu'biusk to hold a divine tournament to select a new leader. The World Guardian fought in the tournament on behalf of the cave goblins, and won.

With the assistance of the World Guardian, the conflict between the elven clans was resolved, and the elven city of Prifddinas was restored from crystal seed.

Attracted by the bountiful Anima Munde of Gielenor, Tuska the World-Eater set her sights on the world, and began traveling towards Gielenor in order to consume it. (World Event 3: Tuska Comes) Representatives of Saradomin, Zamorak, Armadyl, and the Godless banded together to stop her. Tuska's corpse now rests in the ocean west of the desert.

Seren, no longer constrained by the Edicts of Guthix, began struggling to reunite herself. But she lacked a body, and her mind was broken. With the help of the eight elven clan leaders and the World Guardian, her body was reformed. With some assistance from Zaros, her mind was made whole again, and Seren was restored. However, she does not wish to rule the Elves.

#Impact on Gameplay

Since the game of Runescape is now set in the Sixth Age, The World Wakes and other Fifth-Age quests happened in the past, and are played "in flashback". The Sixth Age quests are so far on a new quest tree: The World Wakes is a grandmaster quest, but Missing Presumed Death (the next quest chronologically) is a Novice quest with much lower requirements. Similarly, Sixth-Age content so far does not require completion of The World Wakes.

In addition to The World Wakes, the following quest storylines (and all their quest prerequisites) are also played in flashback:

* Mahjarrat
* Fairytale
* Pirate
* Temple Knights
* Desert
* Arrav
* Myreque
* Elf (up to Plague's End)
* Fremmenik
* Gnomes
* Recipe for Disaster
* Summer
* Dorgushuun Goblins
* Void Knights
* King Arthur

To minimize discontinuity for new or lower-leveled players, it is recommended to complete quests in the following order:

1. Finish off the following Fifth-age story lines in any order by finishing these quests: Ritual of the Mahjarrat, The Chosen Commander, The Void Stares Back, The Lord of Vampyrium, Firemaker's Curse

2. The World Wakes

3. Missing Presumed Death

4. The rest of the Sixth Age quest tree, starting with: Fate of the Gods, The Mighty Fall, and Plague's End.
